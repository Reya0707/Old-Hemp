        Hemp is considered the foundation sire or <em>
          "father" of the Border Collie breed.
        </em> He was
        owned by Adam Telfer, and was used as a working dog to herd sheep. His style was different from that
        commonly seen
        during his era, as he worked far more quietly than the other sheepdogs of the time. This style was
        adopted and used by
        other breeders and trainers, and became the most common style among Border Collies within a few
        generations, with his
        descendants becoming successful international sheepdog champions.

      <p class="breed">
        The modern Border Collie is recognised to be an <em>
          extremely intelligent, athletic, and energetic breed.
        </em>
        The breed
        originated in Northumberland on the borders of England and Scotland, having been developed over
        centuries for herding
        sheep. There is some debate over the origins of the breed, although they are likely traced back to the
        Romans two
        thousand years ago who brought their drover dogs with them, and the Vikings who invaded this part of
        England some 1200
        years ago and brought their Spitz-type dogs with them. Regardless of its origins, the Border Collie is
        now recognized as
        the ultimate herding dog with a natural instinct to herd using its “eye” (controlling livestock by
        staring at them in a
        silent and controlled manner) that is unlike any other dog breed.
